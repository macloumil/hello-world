# hello-world
my first repository

Hi everyone!

My name is Macy Miller and I am a graduate student at Bryant University. My MBA specialization is in Business Analytics, which I've hear is a pretty big deal these days. I am hoping to start my career in analytics/consulting in Boston, Massachusetts. I am a die-hard New England sports fan, a lover of coffee and dogs, and believe that there is not greater gift in life than a strong, supportive network of family and friends. I have the best parents and sister a girl could ask for, and have been dating the love of my life for four years. I can't wait to re-enter the working world and become a successful business woman in my favorite city in the world.
